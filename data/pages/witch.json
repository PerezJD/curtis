We unveiled the first public gameplay demo of Witch at DreamHack Dallas 2019, and followed that up with showings in 2019 at QuakeCon and Tokyo Game Show. While I joined the team as a level designer, I eventually became involved in creating the game's environment art, materials, and effects, and prototyping core gameplay elements."
